In this section, we outline the workflow for decomposition-invariant based mixed integer convex optimization over structured polytopes. We begin by introducing the Boscia Framework and the decomposition-invariant Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and then provide a detailed description of how these two methods are integrated.
